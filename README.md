git_practice
============

This repository contains an automated exercise system aimed at helping
people get into Git by solving situational specific problems, but at the
same time getting acquainted with the excellent online resource Pro Git.

Every scenario is self contained and self-verifying within the scripts 
called scenario_X.bash X : 01 ... 19

You simply bash the scenario script, read the output, and do what is requested.
Then you verify your result as shown by the script.

All scenarios, except the first one (01) will supply you with a pre-setup
Git repository.
